## Overview
Convert FoodSync from pull-based polling to push-based event-driven architecture for better efficiency and real-time processing.

## Current Implementation Issues
- **Pull-based polling**: Currently polls Google Drive every 5 minutes
- **Duplicate prevention**: Uses local JSON file (`processed_files.json`) which doesn't scale well
- **Inefficiency**: Unnecessary API calls even when no new photos exist
- **Latency**: Up to 5-minute delay before processing new photos

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Push-Based Architecture
- Implement Google Drive Push Notifications API
- Set up webhook endpoint to receive real-time notifications
- Process photos immediately upon upload

### 2. Enhanced Duplicate Prevention
- Move from local JSON file to database solution (SQLite or PostgreSQL)
- Add metadata tracking (processed time, status, retry count)
- Implement transaction-based processing to prevent race conditions

### 3. Implementation Steps
- [ ] Research Google Drive Push Notifications API requirements
- [ ] Design webhook receiver architecture
- [ ] Implement database schema for processed files tracking
- [ ] Create webhook endpoint (FastAPI/Flask)
- [ ] Update GoogleDriveService to support push notifications
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Add monitoring and alerting for webhook failures
- [ ] Update deployment configuration for webhook endpoint

## Technical Requirements
- Google Cloud Pub/Sub or direct webhook endpoint
- Web framework for webhook receiver (FastAPI recommended)
- Database for state management
- SSL certificate for webhook endpoint
- Domain/subdomain for webhook URL

## Benefits
- Real-time processing (seconds vs minutes)
- Reduced API calls and costs
- Better scalability
- More reliable duplicate prevention
- Easier debugging with transaction logs
